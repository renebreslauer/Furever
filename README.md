# FurEver App

FurEver helps users sort through available pets by pet type, size, sex, and age group.  Pulling from the PetFinder API, you can browse all pet profiles with available pictures and relevant information, and filter down your search.

Currently it is a prototype.

Click on the FurEver logo to see all pets available or select particular pet category in order to filter by type.   There other filters are available such as age group (young, adult, senior), sex, and size.

Once you find your perfect match, click on the card to get more information on your selection.

## Dependencies:


The project uses React and ReactDOM libraries as well as React Bootstrap for styling.
Finally we added axios for APIs

### Instructions to Install Dependencies:  
*   [yarn add react-bootstrap bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap "Link to React-bootstrap documentation")
*   [yarn add react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom "Link to the react-router-dom documentation") 
*   [yarn add axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios "Link to the axios documentation") 
*   [yarn add uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid "Link to the UUID documentation")

Once dependencies are installed to run the application use `Yarn dev`to start both the client sever and the develompment server.This command works because of a custom script in our package.json file. To run the client server on its own use `Yarn run` and for the development server use `Node Server` and to keep the develompment server running during code changes use `nodemon server`this commands are run in a console that currently in the application folder
